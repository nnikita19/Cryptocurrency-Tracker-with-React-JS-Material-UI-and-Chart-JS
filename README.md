   React CryptoHunter-Cryptocurrency Tracker with React JS, Material UI and Chart JS. [https://crypto-hunter.netlify.app/](https://crypto-hunter.netlify.app/)
# About App   
1. Latest Real Time based crypto currency rate tracker giving a plot of latest cost showcasing profit or loss in recent time span.
2. Used React.js to make a custom UI & Chart.js to make a real time plot of even very small time duration of the same day.
3. Dynamic platform supporting 2 currencies INR & USD. Having the support of OAuth for authentication purpose.

In this project, I have build a Crypto Currency watch app. While building it, I learn many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them are Google Firebase for Login and Authentication purposes, Chart JS for showing chart for showing regular frequency of currency, React Routers and Coin Gecko API. 

This app helps its user to watch over all the crypto currency prices, there last 24hr changes, its market cap and much more. In todays world everybody wants to invest in digital currency and this app helps them to choose where to invest.
